How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

    This program can easily be applied to different datasets. It is easy to maintain and adapt because at its' core it is  a CRUD application that can be applied to any Mongo Data base with little to no adapatation. The Dashboard can be expanded upon further to add more filters that will beneift whichever data set it is connected to. Creating software that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable allow for scaling and repurposing the software easily, without much leg work.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

    First creating the CRUD model with a MongoDB backend was the first step. Once my python script interfaced with the backend, I then had to create a front-end for the software to be more accessible. Creating a dashboard that could meet Grazioso Salvare's requirements was a must if the system was going to prove useful. This project differed from most as it required creating a front end and back end, which involved creating the application in different phases.     

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

    Computer scientists and software engineers find problems and create solutions. These solutions range from making a E-Commerce site load faster, to creating a system for a hospital that can directly save a life. Computer scientists create software that helps out in day-to-day life. Software like the one created for Grazioso Salvare makes it easier to find animals in a shelter, and allows that data to be accessed by the click of a button. This software will save the employees of Grazioso Salvare a ton of time every day they use it, allowing them to focus on different tasks.
